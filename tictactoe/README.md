# Tic Tac Toe Game - Low Level Design

## Overview

This document outlines the requirements and low-level design for a Tic Tac Toe game implementation. The system handles game initialization, player moves, win/draw detection, and game state management.

## Game Rules

### Basic Rules

- The game is played on a 3×3 grid
- Two players take turns: one player uses 'X', the other uses 'O'
- Players alternate placing their symbols on empty cells
- The first player to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of three symbols wins
- If all cells are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw
- Players cannot place a symbol on an already occupied cell

## Core Requirements

### Game Initialization

1. Create a new game with a 3×3 grid (all cells empty)
2. Assign symbols to players ('X' and 'O')
3. Determine which player goes first (typically 'X')

### Game Play

1. Current player selects an empty cell
2. System validates the move:
   - Checks if the cell is empty
   - Checks if the game is still active
3. If valid:
   - Update the grid with the player's symbol
   - Check for win condition
   - Check for draw condition
   - If game continues, switch to the next player
4. If invalid:
   - Reject the move
   - Ask the player to select a different cell

### Game Completion

1. Detect win condition:
   - Check all rows, columns, and diagonals for three matching symbols
2. Detect draw condition:
   - All cells filled with no winning combination
3. Display appropriate message based on outcome
4. Option to start a new game

## System Components

### Board

- 3×3 grid representation
- Methods to:
  - Initialize an empty board
  - Place a symbol at a specific position
  - Check if a position is empty
  - Display the current state

### Player

- Player identifier
- Assigned symbol ('X' or 'O')
- Optional: player statistics (wins, losses, draws)

### Game

- Board instance
- Player instances
- Current player tracker
- Game state (in progress, won, draw)
- Methods to:
  - Initialize the game
  - Process player moves
  - Check for win/draw conditions
  - Switch players
  - Reset the game

### Move

- Position (row, column)
- Player who made the move
- Timestamp (optional)

## Design Considerations

### Input Validation

- Ensure moves are within board boundaries
- Prevent moves on occupied cells
- Prevent moves after game completion

### State Management

- Maintain the current state of the game
- Track whose turn it is
- Record game history (optional)

## Future Enhancements

### Scalability Options

#### Variable Board Size

- Support for larger grid sizes (4×4, 5×5, etc.)
- Adjustable win condition (e.g., 4 or 5 in a row)

#### Multiple Game Modes

- Timed games
- Tournament mode
- Computer players with varying difficulty levels

#### Advanced Features

- Undo/redo functionality
- Game replay
- Save/load game state

#### Multiplayer Capabilities

- Network play
- User accounts and matchmaking
- Leaderboards and statistics

#### AI Opponents

- Simple random moves
- Strategic AI using minimax algorithm
- Machine learning-based opponents
